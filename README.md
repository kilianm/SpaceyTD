Spacey TowerDefense
===================

HTML5 canvas game, made during a hackathon. The basic game was made in about 1.5 days by 2 people.
It uses the GameJS library for basic things like the game loop ticks, sprites, sounds.

The game will be improved a bit so to make it actually play worthy and fun, instead of just a cool tech demo :)
